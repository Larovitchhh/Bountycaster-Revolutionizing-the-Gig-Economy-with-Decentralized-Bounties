Onchain Summer BuildathonIn collaboration with Base, Bountycaster hosted one of the largest online hackathons focused on building the “new internet” onchain. The event encouraged community-hosted bounties, allowing builders to tackle innovative projects with no affiliation from Base or Coinbase, emphasizing the decentralized nature of the platform.

Build the New Internet HackathonSupported by WalletConnect, 1inch, Coinbase, Safe, and Magic, this UX-focused virtual hackathon offered $50K in prizes across four tracks, showcasing Bountycaster’s ability to attract high-profile partners and foster innovation.

Everyday TasksOne unique bounty example is the offer of 6 USDC for recording 1 hour of natural conversation, with 1 USDC paid per 10 minutes of audio. For recordings with multiple speakers and separated audio tracks, payments are made per speaker, incentivizing collaborative participation.
