Bountycaster is a platform designed to facilitate peer-to-peer bounties and job opportunities, primarily integrated with Farcaster, a decentralized social network, and Twitter/X. It allows users to post tasks or "bounties" with rewards in various cryptocurrencies, such as USDC, ETH, and other tokens like $degen, $OP, and $MOXIE, among others. These bounties can range from simple tasks, like recording everyday conversations for USDC rewards, to complex challenges, such as participating in hackathons like the Onchain Summer Buildathon.

The platform’s mission is to create a seamless and transparent way for individuals to offer and complete paid tasks, fostering a decentralized gig economy. By leveraging Farcaster’s social infrastructure and Base’s blockchain capabilities, Bountycaster ensures that transactions are secure, transparent, and community-driven. It’s a two-person bootstrapped project led by founders Linda Xie (@linda

, making it a lean yet impactful initiative in the crypto space.
