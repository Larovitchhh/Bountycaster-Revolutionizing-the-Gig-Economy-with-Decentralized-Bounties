To work on a bounty, users follow the instructions provided by the poster, which may include replying to the original post or contacting the poster directly to avoid duplicate efforts. Once the task is completed, proof of completion is submitted in the original thread or as specified. The bounty poster then marks the bounty as complete, and payment is made peer-to-peer, often directly on Base to the userâ€™s primary Farcaster address.
