Bountycaster supports a wide range of tokens, including USDC, ETH, $degen, $OP, $MOXIE, and more. Payments are facilitated peer-to-peer, meaning Bountycaster does not take a cut or charge fees for posting or completing bounties. For users unfamiliar with Base, the platform provides guided payment flows, recommending tools like Coinbase to send funds directly to Base addresses for free.
